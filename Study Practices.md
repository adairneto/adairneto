# Study Practices

## Basic Principles

1. Retrieval (self-testing)
2. Spacing out practice
3. Interleaving related topics
4. Try to solve the problem before being taught the solution
5. Make connections
6. Distill underlying principles or rules

## Workflow

1. Before the lecture
    1. Take reading notes (do not take verbatim notes, see the [Rule Sheet](#rule-sheet))
    2. Have a short break (10-15min.)
    3. Free Recall
    4. Open the textbook and make corrections, list possible questions
2. During the lecture
    1. Focus on the lecture
    2. Complement the notes with links between concepts
    3. Ask the questions listed previously, if they weren't already clarified
3. After the lecture
    1. Keep doing free recall (see [Spaced Repetition Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1es65Nhd0D98a2GNO4x6-kmH0SU3m-kYoCRvGDF20Lk8/edit?usp=sharing))
    2. Solve exercises without consulting and interleaving related topics
    3. Correct your answers at least weekly
    4. Review the exercises and their main ideas with free recall (see [Spaced Repetition Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1es65Nhd0D98a2GNO4x6-kmH0SU3m-kYoCRvGDF20Lk8/edit?usp=sharing))
    5. List what you didn't understand and take them to office hours (academic disaster insurance)

## What to do during breaks?

- Be physically active, outdoors, or social
- Leave the screen

## How to review for an exam?

1. List important things and open questions
2. Use the syllabus and notes to answer the questions
3. Take practice tests (with solutions to check after)

## How to prepare for a study session?

- Create a cue for studying time
- Study in different locations

## How to read effectively (SQ3R)?

1. Survey
2. Question
3. Read
4. Recite
5. Review
